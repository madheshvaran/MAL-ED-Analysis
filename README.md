# MAL-ED-Analysis
### Raw Data:
 The raw data which is used for the analysis is downloaded from the following website: https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/record/dataset/DS_5c41b87221
 
### Cleaned Data:
 The cleaned dataset for the Observational Data is too large to be uploaded in Github. 
 Similarly the dataset containing the age (in days) when the observation is taken is too large to be uploaded in Github. Both results can be replicated by using the code and the raw data.
